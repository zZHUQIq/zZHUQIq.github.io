4. 问：Cognition is an emergent property of brain function, reflecting (as Charles Sherrington famously put it a century ago) the integrative action of the nervous system. Nevertheless, it is useful to identify and study distinct neurobiological mechanisms that support disparate functions that contribute to cognition. Which cognitive process is attributable to the functions of brainstem modulatory (biogenic amine) systems?——![[Pasted image 20230423210522.png]]

3. 问：A colleague described a patient that he studied who had a cortical stroke, which resulted in limb weakness and a bizarre denial of impairment (anosognosia). Which limb was (most likely) impaired?(Hint: this women’s anosognosia can be considered an extreme form of hemineglect.)![[Pasted image 20230423215438.png]]

3.  Language
	1. Brain area of L:![[Pasted image 20230424104112.png]]***注***：(1)WA: It is often found in the superior temporal gyrus, roughly the posterior 1 3rd of the superior temporal gyrus.And this network then does the job of encoding the meaning of these symbols. And in terms of language function, this is where the understanding or the comprehension of language is built up in the human brain. (2)BA: Broca's area(the inferior frontal lobe) is an area that is involved in the production of speech. We can understand Broca's area as a premotor cortex for vocal articulation. But it's not just for vocal articulation, Broca's area also seems to be involved with the production of written language.![[Pasted image 20230424111710.png]]![[Pasted image 20230424110229.png]]***注***： We believe that the temporal associational cortex of the right hemisphere is important for interpreting the prosodic quality of speech. That is, the emotional content of speech. And likewise, in the right-sided language regions of the Inferior Frontal Lobe, we have networks that seem to be responsible for imbuing speech with emotion. So, the right hemisphere seems to be very important for that quality of communication. That relies more on emotion than it does on the semantic lexicon that we access as we produce speech.

4. Working Memory
	1. Prefrontal Cortex:Prefrontal essentially means cortex that is anterior or before the motor cortex. So for our purposes, the prefrontal cortex can be localized anatomically as the anterior two thirds of the superior, middle and inferior frontal gyri. Remember our three fingers here on the dorsal-lateral aspect of the cerebral cortex. (1)The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex——are associated with planning, planning behavior based on the integration of sensory signals with other sources of information that would include our memory, our emotion, our interoceptive signals.These functions are exemplified in the phenomenon that we call working memory. This dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex as it turns out also has a very important role in moderating or suppressing behaviors. That would otherwise be considered to be inappropriate.
