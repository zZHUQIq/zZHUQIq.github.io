	2.  transient receptor potential channels:![[Pasted image 20230416213047.png]]
	3. Nerve:![[Pasted image 20230416213345.png]]
	4. 问：If you choose to eat hot and spicy food (as I sometimes do), why does your mouth burn and your scalp sweat (among other visceral sensory and motor reactions)?——1. Capsaicin and related compounds in spicy food activate transient receptor potential (TRP) channels on taste cells in taste buds. 2. Capsaicin and related compounds in spicy food activate transient receptor potential (TRP) channels on free nerve endings of polymodal C nociceptive fibers in oral mucosa. 3. Signals pertaining to the activation of TRP channels are integrated in the nucleus of the solitary tract in the dorsal tegmentum of the caudal pons and upper medulla. 4. Signals pertaining to the activation of TRP channels are integrated in the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the lateral tegmentum of the caudal pons and medulla. 5. Central processing of signals derived from TRP channel activation are distributed to integrative centers in the hypothalamus and brainstem where visceral motor commands are distributed to sweat-­‐promoting preganglionic (sympathetic) neurons. 6. Central processing of signals derived from TRP channel activation are distributed to higher brain centers where sensations are elaborated in cortical networks.
