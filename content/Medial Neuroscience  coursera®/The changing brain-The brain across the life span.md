2. Major Forces In Early Brain Development：![[Pasted image 20230422174606.png]]
3. Neurulation:
	1. Gastrulation:![[Pasted image 20230422192803.png]]***注***：(1)Notochord: It is responsible for sending out chemical signals that interact with this ectoderm that overlies this rod-like structure that runs along the length of the embryo. And these chemical signals induce a change and the fate of the ectoderm that overlies this notochord. The notochord is responsible for reducing the differentiation from the neural plate(This neural plate, or sometimes we call it neuroectoterm will begin the process of forming the entire central nervous system)![[Pasted image 20230422193400.png]]![[Pasted image 20230422193513.png]]![[Pasted image 20230422193615.png]]

	2. Formation of the Early CNS：![[Pasted image 20230422195446.png]]![[Pasted image 20230422195257.png]]***注***：(1)Telencephalon:These telencephalic vesicle are what will give rise to the cerebral hemispheres. (2)Diencephalon:The diencephalon will begin to form these outpockets that we call the optic vesicles. And the optic vesicle is what will go out to form the neural elements of the eyes, specifically the retina. (3)Mesencephalon:It doesn't necessarily increase in size proportionately, nor does it differentiate or subdivide any further in any significant way. (4)Metencephalon:The metencephalon is what will go on to form the pons and the entire cerebellum (5)Myelencephalon:The myelencephalon will form the medulla oblongata.![[Pasted image 20230422200720.png]]![[Pasted image 20230422200516.png]]***注***：The cerebral aqueduct is one way to identify what kind of section through the brain stem you might be inspecting.

		2. Inductive signaling:(1)The Ventral(下) identity is going to give rise to motor circuits and alpha motor neurons that will grow out and connect the central nervous system to effector systems, namely our stride and muscles.(2)And dorsal, It implies the development of somatic sensory neurons that are receiving incoming information about the experiences of our peripheral tissues.![[Pasted image 20230422202108.png]]![[Pasted image 20230422202808.png]]***注***：It's a very important inductive signal and it's one of the principle substances that explains the importance of Vitamin A for early brain development.![[Pasted image 20230422203241.png]]***注***：BMP signalling is especially important in mesodermal tissue. As the name implies Bone Morphogenetic Protein, bmp signaling can induce the development of bone cells. Now, in ectoderm, bmp signalling can induce the formation of epidermis or skin. When noggin and chordin antagonize the bmp signaling pathway preventing BMP from interacting with it's surface bound receptor, that's ectoderm will be diverted from an epidermal fate. to a neural fade, with noggin and chordin, this tissue will differentiate into what we call the neuroectoderm, or the neural plate.![[Pasted image 20230422203806.png]]***注***：This Sonic Hedgehog mediated signaling pathway is critical for the proper closure of the neural tube.![[Pasted image 20230422204011.png]]![[Pasted image 20230422204919.png]]

	2. Migration：![[Pasted image 20230422210824.png]]![[Pasted image 20230422210455.png]]***注***： We can label precursor cells at a particular point in development, and simply ask what has become of the post mitotic neuroblasts that were derived from that population of precursor cells that were marked at a particular time of development. (1)The late first trimester of pregnancy come to populate the inner and the outer margins of the cortical plate. (2)We progress through the second trimester of pregnancy, the cells that are born early in that second trimester come to reside in the lower portion of the cortical plate, in the region that ultimately differentiates into cortical layer six, the inner layer of the cortex that sits just on top of the white matter. (3)And as neurogenesis progresses through that second trimester of pregnancy, extending at least in some cortical regions into the third trimester, we see this progressive population of the cortical plate from the inner layers to the outer layers such that the last cells to take up their residence in the developing cortical plate are those that reside in what would become cortical layers two and three.![[Pasted image 20230422211921.png]]***注***：It's from these ganglionic eminences that inhibitory neurons are born and differentiate. The ganglionic eminences also gives rise to the basal fore brain structures including the basal ganglia and some cells that are part of the amygdala formation.

		4. Synaptic formation:![[Pasted image 20230423105402.png]]![[Pasted image 20230423105504.png]]***注***：(1)The neuregulin is a pre-synaptic protein that can be released and can diffuse into that post, that presumptive post-synaptic cleft. Where it can begin to serve as an inductive signal, which begins to assemble all these proteins that are important for setting up that post-synaptic site. (2)On the pre-synaptic side, neurexin is important for beginning to build up this active zone, where synaptic vesicles begin to interact with snare proteins. One also needs to cluster voltage gated calcium channels near this active zone, such that calcium influx can be local, and it can be rapid, leading to the development of a fusion pore. (3)Neuroligin does complementary functions aggregating the protein complexes that are essential for the insertion of appropriate receptors.![[Pasted image 20230423110221.png]]
