Overview of CNS:![[Pasted image 20230417140755.png]]![[Pasted image 20230417134944.png]]***注***：motor cortex:The motor cortex is the posterior part of the frontal lobe, where our executive functions are integrating sensory, and emotion, and mnemonic signals, and devising plans for the production of behavior.
2. Overview of motor neurons:![[Pasted image 20230417142839.png]]***注***：1.Ventral horn:contain our lower motor neurons 2.What kinds of neurons innervate skeletal muscle?—neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord![[Pasted image 20230417145542.png]]![[Pasted image 20230417145900.png]]![[Pasted image 20230417150333.png]]![[Pasted image 20230417150522.png]]![[Pasted image 20230417150541.png]]

# Upper motor neuronal control of movement
1. Primary motor cortex
	1. Overview about Motor systems: ![[Pasted image 20230418140118.png]]![[Pasted image 20230418141444.png]]![[Pasted image 20230418141518.png]]![[Pasted image 20230418141921.png]]***注***：1.The lateral pathways are primarily associated with a major projection from the cortex to the spinal cord that we call the lateral corticospinal tract. And this is a collection of axons that, as it runs through the brain stem, and specifically in the medulla, forms a structure that we call the medullary pyramid（pyramidal pathway） 2.Corticospinal obviously refers to projections from the cortex to the spinal cord. And for some authors, it means specifically the projections to the cranial nerve nuclei, that are expressing motor behavior. So those would be our somatic motor nuclei and our branchial motor nuclei.
	2. Motor cortex:![[Pasted image 20230418143011.png]]***注***：1.PMC(which is found in the anterior bank of the central sulcus, including much of the crest of the precentral gyrus. and then just in front of that primary motor cortex）2. PC(We find a premotor cortex. And these areas extend into the midline hemispheric surface.)   3.We can identify two nuclei at the thalamus that are primarily responsible for projections to the motor cortex. They are the ventral anterior nucleus and the ventral lateral nucleus. Sometimes, we refer to them together as the VA-VL complex of the thalamus. In addition to input from the thalamus, these divisions of the motor cortex receive important projections from other parts of the cerebral cortex.

PMC:![[Pasted image 20230418143714.png]]![[Pasted image 20230418143918.png]]![[Pasted image 20230418144445.png]]![[Pasted image 20230418151700.png]]![[Pasted image 20230418150203.png]]***问***：What features best differentiates the body map in the precentral gyrus (primary motor cortex) from the post central gyrus (primary somatic sensory cortex)?—The body map in the precentral gyrus is actually not a map of the body and its parts per se, as it is in the postcentral gyrus, but a map of movement intention.

		2. 问：Consider what you would do should you be driving a motor vehicle and you approach a typical, international 3-color traffic light, and the light changes from green to yellow. I trust that the well-practiced motor response in this circumstance is a gentle application of the brake (not the accelerator!) so that you come to a stop in advance of the anticipated change in color from yellow to red. With this scenario in mind, here’s the question: which division of the premotor cortex was chiefly engaged with planning to execute the appropriate motor response given the color change in the traffic light?——the lateral division of the premotor cortex

		2. 问：Imagine that you are a runner at the starting line of a race and you are anticipating the sound of the starter’s signal. You are in the “ready … set” posture awaiting the “go” signal. Your body is ready for action at the sound of that signal.

Overview of eye movements:![[Pasted image 20230419155201.png]]![[Pasted image 20230419155441.png]]***注***：All of the alpha motor neurons, except for these trochlear motor neurons, supply ipsilateral muscles, the third cranial nerve supplies ipsilateral extraocular muscles.![[Pasted image 20230419160621.png]]![[Pasted image 20230419160824.png]]

		7. 问：When looking up into the night sky (while standing), a bolt of lightning struck somewhere off in the far distance to your right and you quickly turn to look at the lightning.
