	2.  A set of cells in a nucleus of the hypothalamus called the Suprachiasmatic nucleus that contain a molecular clock— this molecular clock is responsible for generating our circadian rhythm.![[Pasted image 20230424155508.png]]***注***：The suprachiasmatic nucleus which is in the hypothalamus, and it's the regulator of circadian rhythms.![[Pasted image 20230424155929.png]]
	3. Mechanism：![[Pasted image 20230424160835.png]]***注***：The Hypothalami circuit at just the appropriate time during out circadian cycle can lead to the production of melatonin by the Pineal gland. And melatonin is a very important hormone. It begins to prompt a transition. from wakefulness towards drowsiness and eventually sleep.![[Pasted image 20230424161026.png]]
4. Brain Waves and Sleep Stages
	1. EEG:Normal patterns of electroencephalographic activity generally fall into four recognized frequency bands.Beginning with the lowest frequency bands we can see healthy brain oscillating. And very large amplitude, very slow waves in what's called the Delta band, this is one to four cycles per second, one to four hertz. This as we'll see is indicative of the deepest stage of sleep.The next highest band of activity that is recognized is called the theta band and this is a rhythm between 4 and 7 hertz. Theta activity is consistent with being awake and perhaps being engaged in some sort of active exploration of your surroundings. Next we have the alpha band, the alpha rhythms. Alpha is between 8 and about 13 hertz. And the alpha rhythms seem to be a prominent feature of our sensory cortical areas, especially when those cortical areas are.![[Pasted image 20230424161550.png]]![[Pasted image 20230424161715.png]]![[Pasted image 20230424161941.png]]![[Pasted image 20230424162217.png]]![[Pasted image 20230424162951.png]]
