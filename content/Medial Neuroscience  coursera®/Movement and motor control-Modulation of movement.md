# Modulation of movement by the basal ganglia.
1. Circuitry of the Basal Ganglia:BG(The Basal Ganglia are a collection of nuclei that are found deep in the base of the fore brain. They are developed from the telencephalon, the same part of the developing nervous system that formed the cerebral cortex. Except the neurons of the Basal Ganglia didn't migrate out to the expanding outer sphere of the developing telencephalon, rather the cells that formed the Basal Ganglia stayed close to the base of the, of the ventricular system.)![[Pasted image 20230419210603.png]]![[Pasted image 20230419211155.png]]

Put:The putamen is all about moving the body. So the putamen is the principal recipient of the inputs form the frontal motor cortex and the parietal somatic sensory cortex. 2. Cd:The caudate nucleus received input from the frontal cortex, specifically the parts of the prefrontal cortex that sit just in front of the motor cortex. The caudate nucleus is also receiving input from the anterior part of the premotor cortex, which would include our frontal eye field. So, the caudate nucleus is concerned with movement of the eyes, and with the eyes also goes our mind. 3.Acc:The nucleus accumbens is receiving input from the ventromedial parts of the fore brain that are concerned with processing emotion or affect. So the nucleus accombands/ g is going to be involved with moving affect.![[Pasted image 20230420103359.png]]![[Pasted image 20230420103044.png]]![[Pasted image 20230420104135.png]]***注***：1蓝色部分（The globus pallidus）;1-5-2(下)-The cingulate gyrus and other divisions of the prefrontal cortex.![[Pasted image 20230420103850.png]]![[Pasted image 20230420104744.png]]

# Modulation of movement by the cerebellum
1. overview of Cerebellum.
	1. Function:![[Pasted image 20230420162341.png]]![[Pasted image 20230420162927.png]]
	2. Major parts of cerebellum:![[Pasted image 20230420163306.png]]***注***：(1) Spinocerebellum: It is the part of the cerebellum that is mostly concerned with movements of the arms and the legs. It is receiving input from the spinal cord. (2)Cerebrocerebellum: It is concerned with the skilled movements that we perform with our distal extremities, especially when there's some kind of skill.(3)Vestibulocerebellum: This part of the cerebellum is going to have much to do with calibrating and governing the motor output from our vestibular nuclei.![[Pasted image 20230420165822.png]]![[Pasted image 20230420170109.png]]
2. Cerebellar Circuits：
	1. Input:![[Pasted image 20230420192115.png]]***注***：1. The spinal cord(spinal cerebellum):The pathway that serves the lower extremity involves a relay in the dorsal nucleus of Clarke, which is found in the thoracic segments of the spinal cord. The dorsal nucleus of Clarke grows an axon, that runs up the dorsal lateral white matter of the spinal cord and forms a tract that we call the dorsal spinal cerebellar tract. This is the major relay of proprioceptive signals from the lower extremities into the cerebellum. This pathway runs on the ipsilateral side of the cerebellum and the spinal cord.     2. The massive connection from cortex to pontine nuclei to cerebellum is mainly going into the lateral hemispheres, into that region that we call the cerebral cerebellum.    3. And then these vestibular inputs, that are being sent in some cases directly from the eighth nerve into the cerebellum. And others in a relay through the vestibular nuclei of the brain stem. These are being conveyed to the vestibular cerebellum, that flocculonodular lobe that's tucked underneath the posterior part of the cerebellum.

	4. 问：Suppose you are like me and you have great difficulty controlling your “nerves” when about to perform music (or dance, theatre, etc., whatever performance art form appeals to you). At such moments, what do you think is happening in your “central autonomic network”?——Activity is dramatically increasing in the neural networks that promote sympathetic visceral motor outflow.
3. Hypothalamus：
	1. Overview: The hypothalamus is found in the ventral aspect of the diencephalon, the hypothalamus forms the walls of the third ventricle.![[Pasted image 20230422150743.png]]![[Pasted image 20230422150851.png]]![[Pasted image 20230422151502.png]]
	2. Control:![[Pasted image 20230422151618.png]]![[Pasted image 20230422153123.png]]***注***：(1)3-PN:There is another one called the arcuate nucleus and these nuclei are intimately related to the production of hormones in the anterior part of the pituitary gland. (2)**2-SN**: these are the nuclei that have the neurons that grow their axons through the infundibulum, that is, the stalk of the pituitary, and release hormones directly into the general circulation in the neurohypophysis or the posterior part of the pituitary gland. (3)1-MPN:This is a part of the hypothalamus that is involved in various aspects of coordinating reproduction, and sexual behavior. This medial pre-optic area is also involved in governing the release of urine in the process of micturition. (4)1-SN: This is a nucleus we'll come back to when we talk about the regulation of sleep. The suprachiasmatic nucleus is the master clock of the human body. (5)3-Dorspmedial N+3-VN:These two nuclei seem to be involved in some other dimensions of reproductive behavior, and even parenting behavior. (6)1-LPN+3-LN: They are involved in really a variety of functions that pertain to attention and arousal. And they seem to be in a position to modulate the way the cortex responds to other kinds of inputs.

Here is a representation of the medulla. We potentially could have a Horner syndrome in conjunction with signs and symptoms that would help you localize the lesion to this particular level.![[Pasted image 20230422155305.png]]![[Pasted image 20230422155621.png]]
	4. 问：Which of the following statements DOES NOT characterize a function of hypothalamic nuclei?![[Pasted image 20230422160420.png]]Suppose you are examining a patient who presents with left-sided Horner’s syndrome. You recall learning about this condition in Medical Neuroscience, and you remember that damage of descending projections from the hypothalamus to the sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the intermediolateral cell column may be involved. What would you expect to see upon physical examination?![[Pasted image 20230422160537.png]]
4. Micturition：
	1. Neural control:![[Pasted image 20230422161246.png]]***注***：(1)The sympathetic innervation to the bladder is going to promote bladder filling, so it's going to relax the bladder wall. It's going to contract the internal sphincter muscle, and together that will allow the bladder to fill. (2)The parasympathetic system on the other hand is going to promote the emptying of the bladder. Activation of parasympathetic inputs to the detrusor muscle will cause that muscle to contract and the bladder to void.![[Pasted image 20230422161939.png]]![[Pasted image 20230422162314.png]]![[Pasted image 20230422162500.png]]
